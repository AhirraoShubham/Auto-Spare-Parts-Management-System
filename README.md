	#Auto Spare Part Manegement System

#Problem Definition:

?	 As pre the fast going life of today’s generation, we had developed the structure. The main scope of the system is to maintain the sales of all the spare parts sold by the shop and also maintain the records of the details of spare parts, staff, etc.
?	This System is basically designed to manage the different types of information related about spare parts, customer records, bill details, etc at the shop. This system can be accessed only by the authorized person (user) only.
?	In this system, the software offers to customer to view the stock of spare parts presently available at the shop and print the purchase bill of the spare parts and tries to give complete satisfaction to customer. It also offers to employee to manage their user accounts When a customer comes to purchase a spare parts, the operator give a brief description about the spare parts currently available at the shop when customer purchase the desired parts. It prints the purchase bill to the customer and keep a track on the records.







Existing System
     The existing system is able or capable of giving good response to the user as well as generates efficient reports as required.
      There are some advantages using the existing system that the system is very simple to implements and in this system doesn’t require an export to handle the system.
    The existing system has some disadvantages that the system is manual hence it is time consuming more time is required for the work. The existing system is manual hence human factors can affect the system becomes the sufficient manpower is required for the system, and difficulties is occurred in report generation, because at certain number of customer increases there is difficulty occurs in the existing system the above problem are faced the system.

#Proposed System :
?	Our proposed system will help a lot to reduce the drawbacks as mentioned earlier with the existence system.
?	It is advantages in numerous ways. Some of its advantages are :-
•	Easy to maintain stock details.
•	Time saving for owner as well as customer.
•	Quick interaction with distributor.
•	Well organized records of customer purchase & order from distributor.
•	Customer satisfaction.
•	Fast Service.
•	Maintain the account details with respect to shop.
?	It will maintain the records of the customer’s and sales executives in the shop.
?	We can update the record daily.

#Scope of Proposed system:
?	The system as the name suggest maintains the detail information about the Shop’s activity and management.
?	Administrative users log-in the system with authentication then all the details of customer & staffs is stored in master file. Cash details are also maintained in the database system.
?	System can maintain detailed information about the Auto Spares, Customers and Staff. It maintains spare part details. It also maintains detailed info. About customer by whom parts are purchased.
?	This system has limited scope for implementation. The scopes of system are :
•	All spare parts details are stored in system, but if any new spare part is introduced it must be added.
•	Customer details are stored in the software, if any new customer arrives, details must be added at the same time.
•	It maintains the billing details of the customer purchased.
•	It also maintains information about staff, new staff may be added.


#Objective of Proposed System:
Shop administration system is design by considering following objectives:
?	 Providing customized and user friendly software to user.
?	The technologically superior software that manages shop database more efficiently.
?	Can be operated by a person without any computer experience and requires only a basic low cost computer.
?	Providing all the services, information, reports, etc. any time with full accuracy according to user requirement.


#Fact Finding Technique:
?	 Information gathering in large and complex organization is not an easy task. It has to be gathered in an organized way so that no system details left out and information gathered is of correct type.

?	To this end, proper search strategies must be applied. To determine the requirement of the user and to understand the existing system the technique used was interviewing and record inspiration.

?	Information is collected by interviewing persons related and by inspecting various documents.

#Platform:

?	Hardware Requirements
•	Intel Pentium IV Processor
•	1.80GHz
•	128 MB of RAM

?	Software Requirements :
•	O.S-Windows 98/XP/8.1
•	Java (1.6 or higher)
•	Microsoft Access.

#Feasibility Study:
	It hives the feasibility of our application. All the Development project, development process is starts with feasibility study. The feasibility study is the major factor that contributes to analysis of the software. The input to the feasibility study is online description of the system and how it will be useful to the end user. The result of the feasibility study should be a report, which recommends whether or not it is worth carrying with the requirements engineering and the system development process.
Feasibility considerations are:-
1.	Economical feasibility.
2.	Technical Feasibility.
3.	Operational Feasibility.

1.	Economical Feasibility :-

	Economical feasibility is done to verify whether the new system or application, which is to be developed, is good investment for the organization and whether it is cost effective or not. For the customer, the benefits obtained should be substantially greater than the cost of development of the system.
	This is an open source application which is free to everyone. There is no cost involve in successful execution of this software since it is self-contained, standalone program. And it doesn’t require any software to process on it. Hence the system is economically feasible.

2.	Technical Feasibility :-

	Technical Feasibility is an important part of the feasibility study involving all the technical aspects and result. This basically deals with the technological aspects of the system. In this phase the reliability, technology, performance, maintain ability is studied.
	The hardware and software needed for design and implementation of software is available very easily and hence the system is technically feasible.


3.	Operational Feasibility :-

	Operational feasibility determines if the system will perform well after it has been installed at user’s site and will fulfil the user requirements. The feasibility is proved by customizing the product as per user’s requirements, expectations and suggestions. It involves the consideration of capabilities of end user that how comfortably it can handle device so it is also an important part of feasibility study.
	The users of this application will not require any special training. The software is simple to install & use. The short description of the application would be enough to operate the software. Also they won’t find it difficult to migrate to new versions of the software.
Hence the software is operationally feasible.
